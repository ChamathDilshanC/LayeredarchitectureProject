# 🏗️ Layered Architecture Project

Welcome to the Layered Architecture Project repository! This project demonstrates a robust implementation of the layered architectural pattern, showcasing best practices in software design and development.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns with distinct layers.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable structure for future enhancements.
- **Maintainability**: Well-organized codebase for easier updates and debugging.
- **Testability**: Improved unit testing capabilities due to decoupled components.
- **Flexibility**: Ability to modify or replace individual layers without affecting others.

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

This project implements the following layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interface and user interactions.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core business logic and rules.
3. **Data Access Layer**: Manages data persistence and retrieval operations.
4. **Entity Layer**: Defines the data structures and object models.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
- Database technology, e.g., MySQL
